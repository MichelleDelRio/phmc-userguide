A new PHMC account for staff (agents) is created through a Secure request by the Business Service Liaison (BSL) or Onboarding Team. A consumer/memberâ€™s new PHMC account is created when an agent adds a new user. To do this, the agent initiates the Account Activation process by composing and sending an email to the consumer/member (see the Sending a New Message section, step 2). All new users must activate their new account prior to accessing their PHMC mailbox. The Account Activation is a one-time process. Consumer/member users must be over the age of 12.

1. Click the **Activate Now** button on the email.
